You are an expert React + Appwrite full-stack developer.  
I want you to create a system using React and Appwrite where:  
I am already have a register login forget Authentication system. don't chagne my current Authentication system

Database Info:  
- databaseId = "68a0e8730015131520a3"  
- collectionId = "users"  
- Attributes:  
  - FullName (string)  
  - EmailAddress (string)  
  - PhoneNuber (string)  
  - Address (string)  
  - role (string) → this should be fetched from Appwrite Auth user labels, not from register form  
  - createdAt (datetime)  

Permissions:  
- Role: Users (Create, Read, Update, Delete = true)  

Requirements:  

2. After successful signup, insert a document into the `users` collection with the following data:  
   - FullName → from register form  
   - EmailAddress → from register form  
   - PhoneNuber → from update account form  
   - Address → from update account form  
   - role → get from Appwrite Auth user.labels 
   - createdAt → new Date().toISOString()  
   - authUserId → get from Appwrite Auth account.get() 
3. Make sure Appwrite `authUserId` is used internally to link auth user with the database document.  
4. Provide functions:  
   - signupAndSave(fullName, email, password, ) on database
5. Write clean React code with Appwrite SDK, using async/await and proper error handling.  
6. Add inline comments to explain each part.
